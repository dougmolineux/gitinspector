gitinspector is a statistical analysis tool for git repositories. The defaut analysis shows general statistics per author, which can be complemented with a timeline analysis that shows the workload and activity of each author. Under normal operation, it filters the results to only show statistics about a number of given extensions and by default only includes source files in the statistical analysis.

This tool was originally written to help fetch repository statistics from student projects in the course [Object-oriented Programming Project (TDA367/DIT211)](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/TDA367/) at Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University.

Today, gitinspector is used as a grading aid by universities worldwide.

# Features #

  * Shows cumulative work by each author in the history.
  * Filters results by extension (default: java,c,cc,cpp,h,hh,hpp,py,glsl,rb,js,sql).
  * Can display a statistical timeline analysis.
  * Scans for all filetypes (by extension) found in the repository.
  * Multi-threaded; uses multiple instances of git to speed up analysis when possible.
  * Supports HTML, XML and plain text output (console).
  * Can report violations of different code metrics.

# Example outputs #

Below are some example outputs for a number of famous open source projects. All the statistics were generated using the "-HTlr" flags.

Below is an example of the ouput generated by gitinspector:

```

The following historical commit information, by author, was found in the repository:

Author               Commits   Insertions   Deletions   % of changes
John Smith               288         7721        4617          39.19

Below are the number of rows from each author that have survived and are still intact in the current revision:

Author                     Rows   % in comments

The following history timeline has been gathered from the repository:

The extensions below were found in the repository history (extensions used during statistical analysis are marked):
xml [java] pdf txt css
```

The above output shows a timeline where "+" depicts added lines and "-" depicts removed lines. A "." means that there were changes by that author during that week but the amount of work was very small in relation to the rest of the work that week.

The number of signs in no way describes the size of the work, rather, it is the amount of work each week in relation to the other authors.
