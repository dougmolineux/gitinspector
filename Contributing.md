# Contributing to gitinspector #

If you want to contribute to gitinspector, there are many ways to help; writing documentation, adding translations and contributing code in the form of new features or bug fixes. Any help is appreciated.

# Contributing documentation #

Contact the the current maintainer and inform that person about the documentation you want to add and why you think it is a good idea. If accepted you will be added as an official contributor to the project and given responsibility for the documentation you add.

# Contributing new translations #

Currently, gitinspector supports the following languages:
  * Chinese
  * English
  * French
  * German
  * Italian
  * Korean
  * Polish
  * Russian
  * Swedish

If you have good language skills in any unsupported language, you can help with translation of gitinspector to that language. The best way is to simply open a new issue of type "Translation" and tell us about the translation you want to add. If accepted, you will be added as an official contributor to the project. Whenever the translation needs updating; someone will re-open the issue and you will be informed about it if you have "starred" the issue.

# Contributing bug fixes and/or new features #

If you are a developer and want to contribute code to gitinspector, the best first approach is to post patches in the issue tracker. When the patch is accepted; it will be committed under your name to the master branch of the project by one of the developers. Before you start working on a substantial patch, it might be a good idea to start an issue about it to make sure that the maintainer or somebody else isn't already working on the same thing.

If you really want to contribute to gitinspector but can't think of anything to do, you should check out the list of [open issues](https://code.google.com/p/gitinspector/issues/list). Just drop a message in an issue to inform the maintainer that you want to work on that issue and he will assign it to you. All the accepted issues that have not yet been started by anyone are up for grabs.

If your work is substantial enough; we might eventually add you to the project as an official code contributor. Consequently; this means that you also get access the the git repository and can push changes on your own.

> ## What to consider when writing code for new statistics ##
> When coming up with a new code statistic or code metric to add to gitinspector, always consider the original (and main) use case of gitinspector; **the grading of student projects**. Is the statistics or metric you are about to add of any use when evaluating the performance of an author? If it's not, then it's probbaly not worth adding and won't be accepted into the code base. A good statistic is a statistic that can be used when evaluating someone.

# Don't use handles, aliases or any other kind of pseudonym #

Always use or supply your real name when making contributions.  This way, we can properly attribute the contribution to you when pushing it to the master branch. If you don't supply your full name, the contribution will most likely be attributed to one of our developers.
